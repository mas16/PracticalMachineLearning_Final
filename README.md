# Using Machine Learning to Predict Weight Lifting Form from Wearable Accelerometer Data
by MAS, May 2019 

## Introduction
This report describes the construction of a machine learning classifier to predict how well a specific weight lifting excercise was performed. Six classifications were used to describe weight lifting form:

Class A: Proper Form
Class B: Elbows Thrown Forward
Class C: Lifting Halfway
Class D: Lowering Halfway
Class E: Hips Thrown Forward

While we often quantify how much of a given activity we perform, we rarely quantify how well we perform it. Maintaining proper form while weight lifting is essential for maximizing muscle growth and minimizing the risk of injury. Wearable accelerometers may assist in monitoring form given a suitable model to predict form from raw accelerometer data. In this report we present a machine learning model based on random forests that results in an estimated out-of-bag error rate of <1% and an out-of-sample accuracy of >99%.
